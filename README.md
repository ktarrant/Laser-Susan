# Laser-Susan
3D-printed lazy susan enclosing a laser for projecting through objects

## Enclosure
The enclosure houses the laser circuit which projects upwards through
a hole in the top and through the first gear.
The first gear has a second, vertical gear with a pair of springloaded
finger mounts on them to hold an item in place.
The first gear allows the object to be rotated around the vertical axis,
the second gear allows the object to be rotated around the horizontal axis.
The enclosure includes a dash with knob control cutouts.
Outside the first gear is a spot for mounting a lamp shade onto device,
which protects the user's eyes from dangerous refractions off the item.
