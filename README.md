# Laser-Susan
3D-printed lazy susan enclosing a laser for projecting through objects

## Enclosure
The enclosure houses the laser circuit which projects upwards through
a hole in the top and through the first gear.
The first gear has a second, vertical gear with a pair of springloaded
finger mounts on them to hold an item in place.
The first gear allows the object to be rotated around the vertical axis,
the second gear allows the object to be rotated around the horizontal axis.
The enclosure includes a dash with knob control cutouts.
Outside the first gear is a spot for mounting a lamp shade onto device,
which protects the user's eyes from dangerous refractions off the item.

### Gear Design
This project uses some 3D-printed gears to stabilize the lazy susan.
The designs use M3 screws and bolts, such as from here:

It also uses 7mm wide compression springs, such as from here:

#### Basic Gear Example
The designs under:
`enclosure/basics`
provide an example of the gear mechanism.
The example can be built using a
M3 x 16mm screw, washer, and bolt;
and a
0.3mm x 4mm x 15mm compression spring.
